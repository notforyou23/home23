/**
 * neighbor-state — builds each agent's public state surface for peers.
 *
 * Served at GET /__state/public.json by the dashboard. Each peer agent
 * polls this endpoint via NeighborChannel and ingests observations as
 * UNCERTIFIED bus signals (the state is second-hand by construction).
 *
 * Shape is intentionally minimal: active goals (sparse), last N verified
 * observations, current focus text, dispatch state, last-memory-write
 * timestamp. No identity leak, no private thought graph access.
 *
 * See docs/design/STEP24-OS-ENGINE-REDESIGN.md §The Neighbor Protocol Extension.
